About Me
I am a high-achieving senior at Andover High School in Andover, Massachusetts. I currently have a weighted GPA of 4.45 and have recieved high honors distinction every year. Outside of the classroom, I am a competitive tennis player who plays for the Willows Racquet Club girls' team year-round and the Andover High School girls' varsity team during the spring season. As a student-athelete, I consistenly demonstrate exceptional time management skills, dillegience, determination, leadership, and integrity.

I am a 17-year-old high school senior of Korean descent from Andover, Massachusetts. I was born in Boston, MA to Daniel and Minji Kim. I have one younger sister named Amanda who is currently a freshman at Andover High School. At 4 years old, my family and I moved to Andover, at which time I entered the Andover Public Schools system. In my free time, I like to watch Korean dramas, play tennis, and go shopping. 

Service has always been an important part of my family's life as well as my own. Every Friday evening, I volunteer for Awana, a program at my church for children. I help supervize game time and help the children memorize Bible verses. In the summer, I also serve at my church's Vacation Bible School. In the fall and spring, my high school tennis coach runs a tennis clinic for the youth in the community. I love volunteering as an assistant coach because I get to interact with children and help them learn my favorite sport.

                                <p>You’ll probably eat about 3,000 meals during your time at college (never mind the countless cups of coffee and snacks along the way). So, while food isn’t the only thing to consider in a school, it’s important to know you’ll have plenty of nutritious and delicious options to fuel you through. With six different dining venues around campus, Gordon partners with <a href= "https://www.bonappetit.com/">Bon Appétit</a> to offer a generous variety. Using a “Farm to Fork” program, Bon Appétit shares Gordon’s commitment and passion for sustainability, fresh and locally-sourced food, and nutrition and wellness. We also pay special attention to dietary restrictions, so no need to worry if you’re vegan or gluten-free; we’ll work with you to make sure you have delicious options that fit your needs.</p>
